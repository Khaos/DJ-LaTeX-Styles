This survey discuses practical applications of outlier mining, and provides a taxonomy for categorizing related mining techniques.

@article{AD4PP:Arranz2008DADICC,
	Abstract = {DADICC is the abbreviated name for an intelligent system able to detect on-line and diagnose anomalies as soon as possible in the dynamic evolution of the behaviour of a power plant based on a combined cycle gas turbine. In order to reach this objective, a modelling process is required for the characterization of the normal performance when any symptom of a possible fault is present. This will be the reference for early detection of possible anomalies. If a deviation in respect to the normal behaviour predicted is observed, an analysis of its causes is performed in order to diagnose the potential problem, and, if possible, its prevention. A multi-agent system supports the different roles required in DADICC. The detection of anomalies is based on agents that use models elaborated using mainly neural networks techniques. The diagnosis of the anomalies is prepared by agents based on an expert-system structure. This paper describes the main characteristics of DADICC and its operation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Existing studies in data mining mostly focus on finding patterns in large datasets and further using it for organizational decision making. However, finding such exceptions and outliers has not yet received as much attention in the data mining field as some other topics have, such as association rules, classification and clustering. Thus, this paper describes the performance of control chart, linear regression, and Manhattan distance techniques for outlier detection in data mining. Experimental studies show that outlier detection technique using control chart is better than the technique modeled from linear regression because the number of outlier data detected by control chart is smaller than linear regression. Further, experimental studies shows that Manhattan distance technique outperformed compared with the other techniques when the threshold values increased},

The author investigates the relationship between the degree of novelty of input data and the corresponding reliability of the outputs from the network.

@article{KDE-GCE:Botev2008RareEvents,
	Abstract = {Although importance sampling is an established and effective sampling and estimation technique, it becomes unstable and unreliable for high-dimensional problems. The main reason is that the likelihood ratio in the importance sampling estimator degenerates when the dimension of the problem becomes large. Various remedies to this problem have been suggested, including heuristics such as resampling. Even so, the consensus is that for large-dimensional problems, likelihood ratios (and hence importance sampling) should be avoided. In this paper we introduce a new adaptive simulation approach that does away with likelihood ratios, while retaining the multi-level approach of the cross-entropy method. Like the latter, the method can be used for rare-event probability estimation, optimization, and counting. Moreover, the method allows one to sample exactly from the target distribution rather than asymptotically as in Markov chain Monte Carlo. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for a variety of applications.},

	Abstract = {Providing engineers and asset managers with a too] which can diagnose faults within transformers can greatly assist decision making on such issues as maintenance, performance and safety. However, the onus has always been on personnel to accurately decide how serious a problem is and how urgently maintenance is required. In dealing with the large volumes of data involved, it is possible that faults may not be noticed until serious damage has occurred. This paper proposes the integration of a newly developed anomaly detection technique with an existing diagnosis system. By learning a Hidden Markov Model of healthy transformer behavior, unexpected operation, such as when a fault develops, can be flagged for attention. Faults can then be diagnosed using the existing system and maintenance scheduled as required, all at a much earlier stage than would previously have been possible.},

	Abstract = {Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and application domains. Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

Such "exemplars" can be found by randomly choosing an initial subset of data points and then iteratively refining it, but this works well only if that initial choice is close to a good solution. We devised a method called "affinity propagation," which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time.},

@article{FDI:Gupta2008FDIInAGTA,
	Abstract = {Degradation monitoring is of paramount importance to safety and reliability of aircraft operations and also for timely maintenance of its critical components. This two-part paper formulates and validates a novel methodology of degradation monitoring of aircraft gas turbine engines with emphasis on detection and isolation of incipient faults. In a complex system with multiple interconnected components (e.g. an aircraft engine), fault isolation becomes a crucial task because of possible input-output and feedback interactions among the individual components.
This paper, which is the first of two parts, presents the underlying concepts of fault detection and isolation (FDI) in complex dynamical systems. The FDI algorithms are formulated in the setting of symbolic dynamic filtering (SDF) that has been recently reported in literature. The underlying concept of SDF is built upon the principles of symbolic dynamics, statistical pattern recognition, and information theory. In addition to abrupt large faults, the SDF-based algorithms are capable of detecting slowly evolving anomalies (i.e. deviations from the nominal behaviour) based on analysis of time series data of critical process variables of different engine components. The second part, which is a companion paper, validates the concept, laid out in the first part, on the simulation test bed of a generic two-spool turbofan aircraft engine model for detection and isolation of incipient faults.},

Using maximum entropy approximations of differential entropy, we introduce a family of new contrast (objective) functions for ICA. These contrast functions enable both the estimation of the whole decomposition by minimizing mutual information, and estimation of individual independent components as projection pursuit directions, The statistical properties of the estimators based on such contrast functions are analyzed under the assumption of the linear mixture model, and it is shown how to choose contrast functions that are robust and/or of minimum variance, Finally, we introduce simple fixed-point algorithms for practical optimization of the contrast functions. These algorithms optimize the contrast functions very fast and reliably.},

	Abstract = {A fundamental problem in neural network research, as well as in many other disciplines, is finding a suitable representation of multivariate data, i.e. random vectors. For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so thar the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation.

@article{ICA:Lee2004StatiscalDynamic,
	Abstract = {Most multivariate statistical monitoring methods based on principal component analysis (PCA) assume implicitly that the observations at one time are statistically independent of observations at past time and the latent variables follow a Gaussian distribution. However, in real chemical and biological processes, these assumptions are invalid because of their dynamic and nonlinear characteristics. Therefore, monitoring charts based on conventional PCA tend to show many false alarms and bad delectability. In this paper, a new statistical process monitoring method using dynamic independent component analysis (DICA) is proposed to overcome these disadvantages. ICA is a recently developed technique for revealing hidden factors that underlies sets of measurements followed on a non-Gaussian distribution. Its goal is to decompose a set of multivariate data into a base of statistically independent components without a loss of information. The proposed DICA monitoring method is applying ICA to the augmenting matrix with time-lagged variables. DICA can show more powerful monitoring performance in the case of a dynamic process since it can extract source signals which are independent of the auto- and cross-correlation of variables. It is applied to fault detection in both a simple multivariate dynamic process and the Tennessee Eastman process. The simulation results clearly show that the method effectively detects faults in a multivariate dynamic process. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

So the application of traditional PCA-based fault detection method can bring many misdiagnoses. A reformative PCA-based fault detection method suitable for power plant process is proposed. First K-mean cluster analysis is used to classify the process data and obtain the data sets under the various stable operating condition. Then the PCM group is established using the classified data sets to describe the entire process. Finally the detecting sample is carried on fuzzy partition during fault detecting and the PCM suitable for current operating condition is dynamically calculated and used for fault detection. The field data is used to contrast the application of traditional method with reformative method in the fault detection of boiler process. The results indicate that the reformative method can adapt the operating condition change, reduce the misdiagnosis and enhance the detection sensitivity. ?2005 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {As advances in networking technology help to connect the distant corners of the globe and as the Internet continues to expand its influence as a medium for communications and commerce, the threat from spammers, attackers and criminal enterprises has also grown accordingly. It is the prevalence of such threats that has made intrusion detection systems-the cyberspace's equivalent to the burglar alarm join ranks with firewalls as one of the fundamental technologies for network security. However, today's commercially available intrusion detection systems are predominantly signature-based intrusion detection systems that are designed to detect known attacks by utilizing the signatures of those attacks. Such systems require frequent rule-base updates and signature updates, and are not capable of detecting unknown attacks. In contrast, anomaly detection systems, a subset of intrusion detection systems, model the normal system/network behavior which enables them to be extremely effective in finding and foiling both known as well as unknown or "zero day" attacks. While anomaly detection systems are attractive conceptually, a host of technological problems need to be overcome before they can be widely adopted. These problems include: high false alarm rate, failure to scale to gigabit speeds, etc. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of anomaly detection systems and hybrid intrusion detection systems of the recent past and present. We also discuss recent technological trends in anomaly detection and identify open problems and challenges in this area. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{CRDLS:Polonik1995DensityLevelSets,
	Abstract = {By using empirical process theory, the so-called excess mass approach is studied. It can be applied to various statistical problems, especially in higher dimensions, such as testing for multimodality, estimating density contour clusters, estimating nonlinear functionals of a density, density estimation, regression problems and spectral analysis. We mainly consider the problems of testing for multimodality and estimating density contour clusters, but the other problems also are discussed. The excess mass (over C) is defined as a supremum of a certain functional defined on C, where C is a class of subsets of the d-dimensional Euclidean space. Comparing excess masses over different classes C yields information about the modality of the underlying probability measure F. This can be used to construct tests for multimodality. If F has a density f, the maximizing sets of the excess mass are level sets or density contour clusters of f, provided they he in C. The excess mass and the density contour clusters can be estimated from the data. Asymptotic properties of these estimators and of the test statistics are studied for general classes C, including the classes of balls, ellipsoids and convex sets.},

It improves on a recent procedure of Park and Marron (which itself is a good method) in various ways.  First, the new method has superior theoretical performance; second, it also has a computational advantage; third, the new method has reliably good performance for smooth densities in simulations, performance that is second to none in the existing literature.  These methods are based on choosing the bandwidth to (approximately) minimize good quality estimates of the mean integrated squared error.  The key to the success of the current procedure is the reintroduction of a nonstochastic term which was previously omitted together with use of the bandwidth to reduce bias in estimation without inflating variance.},

	Abstract = {One way to describe anomalies is by saying that anomalies are not concentrated. This leads to the problem of finding level sets for the data generating density. We interpret this learning problem as a binary classification problem and compare the corresponding classification risk with the standard performance measure for the density level problem. In particular it turns out that the empirical classification risk can serve as an empirical performance measure for the anomaly detection problem. This allows us to compare different anomaly detection algorithms empirically, i. e. with the help of a test set. Furthermore, by the above interpretation we can give a strong justification for the well-known heuristic of artificially sampling "labeled" samples, provided that the sampling plan is well chosen. In particular this enables us to propose a support vector machine (SVM) for anomaly detection for which we can easily establish universal consistency. Finally, we report some experiments which compare our SVM to other commonly used methods including the standard one-class SVM.},

In terms of search strategies, we broadly classify them as topographic and symptomatic search techniques. Topographic searches perform malfunction analysis using a template of normal operation, whereas, symptomatic searches look for symptoms to direct the search to the fault location.

This comparative study reveals the relative strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches. One realizes that no single method has all the desirable features one would like a diagnostic system to possess. It is our view that some of these methods can complement one another resulting in better diagnostic systems. Integrating these complementary features is one way to develop hybrid systems that could overcome the limitations of individual solution strategies. The important role of fault diagnosis in the broader context of process operations is also outlined. We also discuss the technical challenges in research and development that need to be addressed for the successful design and implementation of practical intelligent supervisory control systems for the process industries.

@article{FDD:Venkatasubramanian2003ReviewI,
	Abstract = {Fault detection and diagnosis is an important problem in process engineering. It is the central component of abnormal event management (AEM) which has attracted a lot of attention recently. AEM deals with the timely detection, diagnosis and correction of abnormal conditions of faults in a process. Early detection and diagnosis of process faults while the plant is still operating in a controllable region can help avoid abnormal event progression and reduce productivity loss. Since the petrochemical industries lose an estimated 20 billion dollars every year, they have rated AEM as their number one problem that needs to be solved. Hence, there is considerable interest in this field now from industrial practitioners as well as academic researchers, as opposed to a decade or so ago. There is an abundance of literature on process fault diagnosis ranging from analytical methods to artificial intelligence and statistical approaches. From a modelling perspective, there are methods that require accurate process models, semi-quantitative models, or qualitative models. At the other end of the spectrum, there are methods that do not assume any form of model information and rely only on historic process data. In addition, given the process knowledge, there are different search techniques that can be applied to perform diagnosis. Such a collection of bewildering array of methodologies and alternatives often poses a difficult challenge to any aspirant who is not a specialist in these techniques. Some of these ideas seem so far apart from one another that a non-expert researcher or practitioner is often left wondering about the suitability of a method for his or her diagnostic situation. While there have been some excellent reviews in this field in the past, they often focused on a particular branch, such as analytical models, of this broad discipline. The basic aim of this three part series of papers is to provide a systematic and comparative study of various diagnostic methods from different perspectives. We broadly classify fault diagnosis methods into three general categories and review them in three parts. They are quantitative model-based methods, qualitative model-based methods, and process history based methods. In the first part of the series, the problem of fault diagnosis is introduced and approaches based on quantitative models are reviewed. In the remaining two parts, methods based on qualitative models and process history data are reviewed. Furthermore, these disparate methods will be compared and evaluated based on a common set of criteria introduced in the first part of the series. We conclude the series with a discussion on the relationship of fault diagnosis to other process operations and on emerging trends such as hybrid blackboard-based frameworks for fault diagnosis.

The gradient method is used to find a local minimum of objective function efficiently, and PSO with potential parallel search is employed to help the minimization sequence to escape from the previously converged local minima to a better point which is then given to the gradient method as a starting point to start a new local search. The above search procedure is applied repeatedly until a global minimum of the objective function is found. In addition, a repulsion technique and partially initializing population method are also incorporated in the new algorithm to increase its global search ability. Global convergence is proven, and tests on benchmark problems show that the proposed method is more effective and reliable than the existing optimization methods.},
